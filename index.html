    <h1>∴ SATORU LICENSE INITIATIVE (SLI)</h1>
    <p>The <strong>SATORU LICENSE INITIATIVE</strong> is a public effort to provide an open, protective, and ethical framework for cultural, symbolic, and philosophical works shared in the commons.</p>

    <h2>About the License</h2>
    <p>The <strong>SATORU PUBLIC WISDOM LICENSE (SPWL) v1.0</strong> is designed to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Protect non-commercial cultural and philosophical works from commercial exploitation</li>
        <li>Preserve attribution and original meaning of shared ideas</li>
        <li>Allow free reuse, translation, and non-commercial adaptation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is inspired by the idea that not all knowledge should be for sale. Some ideas exist to be shared freely — for teaching, reflection, and collective growth.</p>

    <h2>How to Use It</h2>
    <p>Any author, thinker, developer, or educator may use this license to share their own work under similar principles. To apply it, simply include the <code>LICENSE.md</code> file and clearly link to this initiative:</p>
    <pre>https://github.com/satorusource/satoru-license-initiative</pre>

    <h2>Vision</h2>
    <p>This license began as a way to protect the text known as <em>Code1</em> and the symbolic term “SATORU” from commercial misuse, malicious distortion, and ideological appropriation. But it is not limited to one project.</p>
    <p>Our vision is to make SPWL a recognized standard — used by other philosophers, creators, collectives, and open projects around the world. The license will remain open, versioned, and in the future — <strong>moderated through an independent structure</strong>: open, non-commercial, and non-intrusive to creativity, yet preserving the license as a repository of meaning and a point of trust.</p>

    <h2>Join the Movement</h2>
    <p>If you resonate with this idea — use the license, share it, or help translate it. The more people adopt it, the stronger the commons becomes.</p>
    <p>Let’s protect what must remain free.</p>

    <p><strong>SPWL v1.0</strong> — issued by the SATORU LICENSE INITIATIVE (2025)</p>

    <h2>Help Shape the Future</h2>
    <p><strong>Your input matters.</strong><br>
    If something can be clearer, stronger, or more fair — contribute.<br>
    Together, with community wisdom, we’ll shape the next version.</p>
