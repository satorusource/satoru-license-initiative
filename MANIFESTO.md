# ∴SLI — MANIFESTO

The SATORU LICENSE INITIATIVE exists to defend meaning, not ownership.

We believe:
- Wisdom belongs to all
- Ideas must circulate, not accumulate
- No one should own a name meant for everyone

This license welcomes creators, researchers, and engineers alike — including those building the future with code and models.

Even the original author of the SATORU term has permanently renounced any exclusive claim.

SATORU is a signal. This license keeps it moving.
