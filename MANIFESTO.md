# ∴SLI — MANIFESTO

The SATORU LICENSE INITIATIVE exists to defend meaning, not ownership.

We believe:
- Wisdom belongs to all
- Ideas must circulate, not accumulate
- No one should own a name meant for everyone

This license welcomes creators, researchers, and engineers alike — including those building the future with code and models.

SPWL v1.1 is the current and only valid version.  
Previous drafts are null and void.

Even the original author of the SATORU term has permanently renounced any exclusive claim.

SATORU is a signal. This license keeps it moving.
