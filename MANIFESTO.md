SATORU PUBLIC WISDOM LICENSE -- MANIFESTO

We live in an age where information flows like air, yet wisdom remains rare.

This license was born not as a legal weapon, but as a philosophical shield -- to protect the free sharing of insight, knowledge, and transformative thought.

It is meant for thinkers, coders, creators, mystics, rebels -- those who know that ideas must travel freely if they are to awaken the world.

The SATORU LICENSE is not about ownership. Itâ€™s about resonance. About ensuring that what you release into the world cannot be turned against it for profit or control.

This license is not perfect. But it is honest. And it begins a new movement -- one where the sacred is not sold, and the future belongs to all.

Use it if you feel it. Rewrite it if you must. But never forget: wisdom is not owned.
